Tolstoy
=======

These are rough drafts of a few works by Tolstoy. I am actively (starting 3/22/2016) working on _War and Peace_ again.

Currently I hold the copyright to all these translations and reserve all rights. I hope to put them under a fairly permissive license once they're polished and ready for publication, which will allow for mashups (such as adding critical apparatus, adapting for other media, etc.). Childhood, released on February 9, 2015 in ebook form, is available under a Creative Commons license that permits certain additional rights to readers/buyers---see the copyright file for that book for more information.
