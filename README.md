Tolstoy
=======

These are rough drafts of a few works by Tolstoy. I am actively (8/13/2014) working on _Childhood_, Tolstoy's first novella, usually collected with _Adolescence_ and _Youth_. I have a few early chapters of _War and Peace_ done but am shifting my attention to Tolstoy's earlier work first.

Currently I hold the copyright to all these translations and reserve all rights. I hope to put them under a fairly permissive license once they're polished and ready for publication, which will allow for mashups (such as adding critical apparatus, adapting for other media, etc.).
